The following CSS code snippet exhibits unexpected behavior in certain browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  height: 50%;
  background-color: blue;
  display: inline-block;
}
```

The issue arises when the parent container does not have its width explicitly set.  In some cases, the div might not render to 50% of the parent's width, but instead takes up the entire available width.
